# ECS 171 Project Team 19 - ML Approaches to Predict Football Play Outcome

## HOW TO RUN: 

### Dependencies: 

- Pandas
- Numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- cvxpy



### Data Preprocesing Code: 
1.  Ensure original dataset ['NFL Play by Play 2009-2018 (v5).csv'](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016) is downloaded and is located in  the ```Data_Preprocessing_Code``` directory.
2. Run ```ECS171project_final_data_preprocessing.ipynb```
   - This will generate a new csv file, ```NFL_data_super_cleaned.csv``` in the ```Data_Preprocessing_Code``` directory.

### ML Model Code: 
1. Move ```NFL_data_super_cleaned.csv``` into the ```ML_Models``` directory.
2. Pick a model to run!

### Frontend: 
Documentation in progress.

## Description of project:

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning solution to predict the outcome of a football play, based on 8 categorical and continuous attributes related to game play. 

## Dataset Used: 
['NFL Play by Play 2009-2018 (v5)'](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016) from Kaggle
