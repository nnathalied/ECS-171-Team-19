# ECS 171 Project Team 19 - ML Approaches for Predicting the Outcome of Football Plays

# üèà Description of Project

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning solution to predict the outcome of a football play, based on 8 attributes related to game play.

# Dataset Used

['NFL Play by Play 2009-2018 (v5)'](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016) from Kaggle

# How to Run Project Locally

## Data Preprocessing and ML Model Dependencies: 

- Pandas
- Numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- cvxpy



## üìä Run Data Preprocessing Code: 

1.  Ensure original dataset ['NFL Play by Play 2009-2018 (v5).csv'](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016) is downloaded and is located in  the ```Data_Preprocessing_Code``` directory.
2. Run ```ECS171project_final_data_preprocessing.ipynb```
   - This will generate a new csv file, ```NFL_data_super_cleaned.csv``` in the ```Data_Preprocessing_Code``` directory.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Run ML Model Code: 
1. Move ```NFL_data_super_cleaned.csv``` (generated by ```ECS171project_final_data_preprocessing.ipynb```) into the ```ML_Models``` directory.
2. Pick a model to run!


## üñ•Ô∏è Run Interactive Frontend:

#### 1. Frontend Dependencies:
***Documentation in progress.***

#### 2. Frontend Environment Setup:
***Documentation in progress.***

#### 3. Run Frontend:

1. Move dataset ```NFL_data_super_cleaned.csv``` to ```NFLPredictService``` directory.
2. Run the notebook ```Generate_SVM_Model.ipynb``` (takes 2-8 minutes to run).
   This will generate 2 new files in the  ```NFLPredictService``` directory: 
   1. ```finalized_svm_model.sav``` (Pickle archive of the trained SVM model).
   2. ```scaler.pkl``` (Pickle archive of the scaler used by the SVM model).

3. Go to the directory ```NFL_Score_Predict``` and run ```predict.html```.
   This should start a server and give you the option to open the Frontend in a browser. From there, you can input your own football plays into the form on the "Predict" tab, and see what the model predicts the outcome of the play will be.


<!-- Noelle:
* upload 2 binary files (SVM model saved using pickle and Scaler saved using pickle)
* update TrainModel.py code in github
* NO svm code hould be in the NFLPredictService Directory
* Dataset (super) DOES need to be in directory for one hot encoding purposes.  -->
